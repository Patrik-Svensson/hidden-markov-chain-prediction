# Hidden Markov Models Challenge 🎲🤖

In this challenge, we dive into various algorithms used with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to analyze sequential data and make predictions. An HMM is a statistical model where the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobservable (hidden) states. This challenge is divided into multiple steps, each tackling a specific algorithm. By completing these steps, you'll gain hands-on experience with HMM algorithms widely used in speech recognition 🎤, bioinformatics 🧬, and natural language processing 📝!

## Challenge Breakdown 🔍

1. **Hmm0**: Initialize and process the emission matrix by reading input data, parsing matrices, and performing matrix operations to compute the state and emission distributions.
2. **Hmm1**: Implement the forward algorithm to calculate the likelihood of observing a sequence given the HMM. 📊
3. **Hmm2**: Apply the Viterbi algorithm to find the most probable sequence of hidden states for a given observation sequence. 🔄
4. **Hmm3**: Use the Baum-Welch algorithm for parameter estimation with the Expectation-Maximization approach to refine HMM parameters iteratively. 🔄🛠️
5. **Hmm4**: Train an HMM using the Baum-Welch algorithm in Java, updating model parameters based on forward and backward probabilities. 🚀

Each section builds upon HMM fundamentals, and by the end, you'll be ready to apply these algorithms in real-world problems! 🎉

## Hmm0 - Initialize & Process Matrices 🔢

In this section, we get our feet wet by initializing and processing the emission matrix. Here’s what happens:

- **Input Reading** 📥: Transition matrix, emission matrix, and initial state distribution are read from a file.
- **Matrix Operations** ➗: Matrix multiplications calculate the state distribution after transitions.
- **Emission Distribution** 🔄: The final emission distribution is computed from the state distribution.
- **Output** 💬: The result is printed to the console, showing the emission distribution.

This step ensures that the emission matrix is properly processed for future algorithms. 🧑‍💻

## Hmm1 - Forward Algorithm 🏃‍♂️

Next, we tackle the **forward algorithm**, which calculates the likelihood of observing a sequence given our model. Here's how we do it:

- **Input** 📥: Reads the transition matrix (A), emission matrix (B), initial state distribution (π), and observation sequence.
- **Alpha Calculation** ➗: The forward algorithm computes the `alpha` vector, which represents the likelihood of the observation sequence at each time step.
- **Final Probability** 💯: The sum of the `alpha` vector is computed and printed, showing the total probability of the observation sequence.

The forward algorithm is essential for calculating how likely our data is under the given model. 🔍

## Hmm2 - Viterbi Algorithm 🏆

In this step, we use the **Viterbi algorithm** to find the most probable sequence of hidden states. Here's what happens:

- **Input** 📥: Reads the transition matrix (A), emission matrix (B), initial state distribution (π), and observation sequence.
- **Viterbi Calculation** 🤔: The algorithm calculates the most probable sequence of hidden states using dynamic programming.
- **Output** 📝: The sequence of hidden states is printed to the console with 0-based indexing.

The Viterbi algorithm helps us decode the hidden states that generated the observed data! 🧩

## Hmm3 - Baum-Welch Algorithm 🔄

In this section, we implement the **Baum-Welch algorithm**, an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm used to estimate HMM parameters. Here's how it works:

- **Input** 📥: Reads the transition matrix (A), emission matrix (B), initial state distribution (π), and observation sequence.
- **Parameter Estimation** 💡: The algorithm iteratively refines the model parameters to maximize the likelihood of observed data.
- **Iterations** 🔁: The algorithm runs for a set number of iterations (50 in this case), adjusting the parameters after each iteration.
- **Output** 📝: The final estimated initial state distribution (π) is printed to the console.

The Baum-Welch algorithm is crucial for training HMMs when the true parameters are unknown. 🧠

## Hmm4 - Training in Java ☕️

In this final section, we use Java to train an HMM with the **Baum-Welch algorithm**. The key steps are:

### Key Steps 📝:

1. **Input Data** 📥: Reads the transition matrix (A), emission matrix (B), initial state distribution (π), and observation sequence.
2. **Forward & Backward Calculations** 🔄: Computes the forward (`alpha`) and backward (`beta`) probabilities at each time step.
3. **Gamma & DiGamma Calculation** 🔢: Derives these values from `alpha` and `beta` to estimate the probability of being in specific states.
4. **Re-estimation of Parameters** 🔧: Updates the model parameters (A, B, π) based on the computed gamma and diGamma values.
5. **Convergence** ⏳: The algorithm iterates, re-estimating parameters until convergence or after a set number of iterations (40).

### Output 📊:
After training, the program prints the updated transition matrix (A), emission matrix (B), and initial state probabilities (π).

### Application 🌍:
This implementation can be applied to various domains like speech recognition 🎤, bioinformatics 🧬, and natural language processing 📝, where we learn hidden state sequences from observed data.
